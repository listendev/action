> Proactive Security Monitoring Inside GitHub Actions üê¨

_Observe network, file, and process behaviors during every workflow run and flags anomalous and malicious activities ‚Äî such as connections to unknown IPs or unauthorized source code changes ‚Äì in your GitHub actions workflows._

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml).

### Basic

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: listendev/action@v0.14.1
    with:
      runtime: only
      jwt: ${{ secrets.LSTN_API_KEY }}
```

### Full

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: listendev/action@v0.14.1
    with:
      # The Github API token.
      # Defaults to ${{ github.token }}
      token: "..."
      # The listen.dev JWT token.
      # Defaults to empty string.
      jwt: ${{ secrets.MY_JWT_TOKEN }}
      # Whether to enable the eavesdrop tool or not to inspect the runtime threats in your CI.
      # Works only on linux runners. Requires a valid `jwt` option.
      # Defaults to false.
      runtime: "true|false|only"
      # The lstn version.
      # Defaults to the latest lstn release tag (recommended).
      lstn: "vX.Y.Z"
      # The working directory relative to the root one.
      # Defaults to the root directory.
      workdir: "."
      # The path to the YAML configuration file.
      # Or the path of the directory containing a .lstn.yaml file.
      # Defaults to empty.
      config: "..."
      # One or more reporting mechanisms (gh-pull-comment,gh-pull-review,gh-pull-check,pro)
      # Defaults to "gh-pull-comment" when there is no JWT input, to "pro" otherwise.
      reporter: "gh-pull-comment"
      # Addition lstn flags for power users
      lstn_flags: ""
```

### Connect to listen.dev

Just [create a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) and pass it to the `jwt` input...

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: listendev/action@v0.14.1
    with:
      runtime: true
      jwt: ${{ secrets.LSTN_API_KEY }}
```

When the action notices that the [listen.dev](https://listen.dev) JWT secret exists, it will automatically override the reporter to the `pro` one.

Because of the `runtime` option set to `true`, it will also start the CI eavesdrop tool under the hoods.

Notice it only works on linux runners.

**Where to get your JWT token?**

[How to get your API key from the project settings](https://docs.listen.dev/workflows/generate-api-token).

It's _recommended_ to regenerate the JWT token for every release, until we will release stable versions.

<details>
<summary>Do you also want to also use another reporter together with the pro one?</summary>

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: listendev/action@v0.14.1
    with:
      jwt: ${{ secrets.LSTN_API_KEY }}
      lstn_flags: "--reporter gh-pull-comment"
```
</details>

### Examples

Let's say you don't want verdicts and events about the dependencies into your lockfiles.
Or maybe your repository doesn't contain lockfiles (package-lock.json, poetry.lock, etc.) at all...

So, you only want it to eavesdrop for runtime threats...

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: listendev/action@v0.14.1
    with:
      runtime: only
      jwt: ${{ secrets.LSTN_API_KEY }}
```

Let's say you want the verdicts in JSON format...

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: listendev/action@v0.14.1
    with:
      lstn_flags: "--json"
```

Let's say you only care for high severity verdicts...

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: listendev/action@v0.14.1
    with:
      lstn: "v0.14.1"
      lstn_flags: "--select '@.severity == \"high\"'"
```

You can select the verdicts also with the `select` input.

Let's say we only care for dynamic instrumentation verdicts regarding processes...

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: listendev/action@v0.14.1
    with:
      select: "(@.file =~ \"^dynamic\" && \"process\" in @.categories)"
```

## Development

To develop this GitHub action you first need to install its dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You can then use `npm run build` to compile it. Also, remember that we check on every pull request that you've run this command, as to avoid the `dist/` directory to be out of sync.

You can also run unit tests locally with the `npm run test` command.

The CI makes extensive use of the official [GitHub reusable workflows](https://github.com/actions/reusable-workflows) for developing actions following best practices (see the [.github](./.github) directory).
